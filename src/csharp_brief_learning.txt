c sharp leARNING very brief

C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.

basic program

using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(" World!");    
    }
  }
}

The first version of Csharp was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 13, was released in November 2024.

C# is case-sensitive; MyClass and myclass have different meaning

Comments are indicated the normal way - // in C sharp also

Console.ReadLine() is the method used to get input from user

if system is expecting integer and u input text , then we get System.FormatException

lets resume from C# Operators

String interpolation was introduced in C#6

example of interpolation in C# : 
string v1 = "Rock"
Console.WriteLine($"My name is {v1}")

Output: My name is Rock

bool is the keyword used to declare boolean datatype in C#

string[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
foreach (string i in cars) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}

To sort , we use Sort() method in C#

int[] myNumbers = {5, 1, 8, 9};
Array.Sort(myNumbers);
foreach(int i in myNumbers)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}

In C#, it is good practice to start with an uppercase letter when naming methods, as it makes the code easier to read.

eg. of method call in C#

static void MyMethod() 
{
  Console.WriteLine("I just got executed!");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  
MyMethod();

}

if we don't specify the access modifier it will be treated as private by default

Inheritance in C# --> class Car : Vehicle

What does the sealed keyword do when used with a class? --> It prevents the class from being inherited.


for the derived classes to override animalSound method we have to use virtual keyword like below

class Animal
{
  public virtual void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

and then in derived class we use keyword override in animalSound method declaration

to achieve abstraction in C# , we have interfaces and abstract classes

What is an interface in C#?

A completely abstract class that can only contain abstract methods and properties.

what is Enum in C#?
A special 'class' that represents a group of constants.

Hello World code exAMple -

using System;

namespace H
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
    }
  }
}

The value of a string variable cannot be surrounded by single quotes in C#
